# Customer-Behaviour-Prediction

The project is about customer retention and behaviour prediction where we aim to develop an algorithm which any business can use to increase the retention rate of the customers and increase the sales of the company. The businesses can use this to change their strategy to increase their profitability.  
Extensive EDA has been performed on the data followed by clustering customers into groups using K-means clustering. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been used to predict sales using keras.  
70% accuracy has been achieved which is a significant improvement over traditional machine learning algorithms and demonstrates the potential of deep learning models in predicting complex customer behaviour.
